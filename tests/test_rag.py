    LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.
    
    Key Features:
    1. Modular Components: LangChain provides modular components for working with language models.
    2. Prompt Management: Tools for managing and optimizing prompts.
    3. Memory: Built-in memory systems for maintaining conversation context.
    4. Document Loaders: Support for loading documents from various sources.
    5. Vector Stores: Integration with vector databases for similarity search.
    6. Chains: Combine multiple components into complex workflows.
    7. Agents: Build autonomous agents that can use tools and reason.
    
    RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines:
    - Document retrieval: Finding relevant documents based on a query
    - Text generation: Using a language model to generate answers based on retrieved context
    
    This approach helps language models provide more accurate and up-to-date information
    by grounding their responses in specific documents rather than relying solely on
    their training data.
