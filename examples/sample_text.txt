LangChain RAG Application - Sample Document

This is a sample text document for testing the LangChain RAG application.

Key Features:
1. Document Processing: The application can process various document formats including PDF, TXT, MD, and DOCX files.
2. Vector Search: It uses ChromaDB for efficient semantic search and document retrieval.
3. AI Chat: Powered by OpenAI's language models for natural conversation.
4. Web Interface: A beautiful Streamlit-based user interface for easy interaction.

Technical Architecture:
- The system uses LangChain for orchestrating the RAG pipeline
- Documents are chunked into smaller pieces for better processing
- Vector embeddings are created using OpenAI's embedding model
- The conversational interface maintains context across multiple interactions

Use Cases:
- Research and document analysis
- Knowledge base querying
- Document summarization
- Information extraction from large document collections

This sample document demonstrates the basic functionality and can be used to test the system's document processing and question-answering capabilities.
